Jelly is a new kind of search engine, without ads, that finds people with experience in the area of your question and delivers helpful answers directly to you.
Your questions are kept anonymous whether you create an account or not. Please feel free to ask anything.
Jelly’s mission is, “To answer the world’s questions simply and helpfully.” Now you don't have to visit [Jelly](https://askjelly.com/) or Download iOS app to ask questions. You can ask questions without leaving [Twitter](https://twitter.com). Wow!! To do so, you just need to add [#askjelly](https://twitter.com/hashtag/askjelly) with your Twitter questions.

Just like this.
When you add #askjelly to your question Tweet, Jelly will import your question into our search engine, get you a good answer, and export that answer as an @reply back to you on Twitter. Jelly’s motivation is to be where the questions are.
